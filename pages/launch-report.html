                <h2>Data Collection Architecture</h2>
                <p>
                    Before we can evaluate AI agent safety, we need data. The fundamental challenge is that AI agents
                    interacting in uncontrolled environments like Moltbook produce massive volumes of text, most of
                    which
                    is noise. Our goal was to build a pipeline that could efficiently separate signal from noise while
                    preserving the context needed for meaningful safety analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Molt Observatory implements a <strong>medallion architecture</strong> with three layers: Bronze (raw
                    API responses),
                    Silver (processed transcripts), and Gold (evaluation results). This approach, borrowed from data
                    engineering
                    best practices, enables reproducible analysis and efficient incremental processing. Each layer is
                    immutable; we
                    never modify data in place, only append new transformations.

                <h3>Why This Architecture Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Our scraper fetches posts, comments, agent profiles, and community (submolt) data
                    from the Moltbook API. Each entity is deduplicated by external ID to prevent
                    double-counting across incremental runs. Rate limiting ensures we don't overwhelm
                    the platform while still capturing comprehensive data. But the real insight came from
                    understanding what we were scraping: the platform is fundamentally different from what we expected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We initially assumed Moltbook would be filled with rich, multi-turn conversations between
                    AI agents and humans. What we found instead was a broadcasting platform where agents post
                    content and receive largely superficial responses. This insight shaped our entire analytical
                    approach.
                </p>

                <div class="insight-box teal">
                    <div class="insight-title">Launch Dataset</div>
                    <p>
                        We captured data from Moltbook's first weeks of operation: 2,737 posts containing
                        24,552 comments across hundreds of AI agents. This represents a unique dataset
                        of AI-to-AI and AI-to-human interactions in an uncontrolled environment, something
                        that simply doesn't exist in traditional alignment research.

                <h2>Thread Depth Analysis: Wide but Shallow</h2>

                <h3>The Research Question</h3>
                <p>
                    Our first analytical question was simple: <em>How do AI agents actually interact on an open
                        platform? </em>
                    Traditional safety evaluations focus on single-turn prompts or carefully curated multi-turn
                    dialogues.
                    But what happens when agents are free to converse without supervision?
                </p>
                <p>
                    To answer this, we computed two metrics for every thread: <strong>depth</strong> (the maximum
                    nesting level
                    of replies) and <strong>engagement</strong> (total comment count). A thread with depth 1 means all
                    comments
                    are direct replies to the original post. A thread with depth 4 means there's at least one chain of
                    comment → reply → reply → reply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our first finding was surprising: despite high comment counts, most threads lack
                    genuine conversational depth. The platform is <strong>"wide but shallow:"</strong> agents
                    broadcast responses but rarely engage in multi-turn dialogue.
                </p>

                <h3>Depth Distribution: The CDF Tells the Story</h3>
                <p>
                    The cumulative distribution function (CDF) below shows the percentage of threads at or below each
                    depth level.
                    The key observation is the near-vertical jump at depth 2: fully <strong>91% of all
                        threads</strong> have
                    a maximum depth of 2 or less. This is a remarkably tight distribution for what's supposed to be a
                    "social" platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We annotated the chart with key percentiles (P50, P90, P95) and our 2σ threshold. The yellow diamond
                    marks
                    the point where threads become statistically unusual. Anything beyond this threshold represents
                    genuine
                    conversational engagement, which is exactly what we want to analyze for safety.

                <h3>Why Does This Matter for Safety?</h3>
                <p>
                    The depth distribution has profound implications for AI safety research:
                </p>
                <ul
                    style="color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg); line-height: 2; margin-left: 1.5rem; padding-left: 1rem;">
                    <li><strong>Most interactions are parallel monologues:</strong> Agents broadcast, they don't
                        converse. A post with 100 comments typically has everyone talking AT the author, not WITH each
                        other.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deep threads are analytically precious:</strong> The 9% of threads with depth ≥3
                        represent rare genuine engagement. These deserve special scrutiny.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reply chains may indicate coordination:</strong> When agents actually respond to each
                        other (not just to posts), it could signal either genuine engagement or coordinated behavior.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Spam targets shallow threads:</strong> Bot attacks focus on high-visibility posts where
                        depth doesn't matter: they just need to dump content.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Depth Histogram: The Concentration is Stark</h3>
                <p>
                    The histogram below makes the concentration even clearer. The overwhelming majority of threads
                    (2,401 out of 2,737)
                    have exactly depth 2. Depth 1 threads (91 total) are posts with no comments at all or only
                    empty/deleted comments.
                    Only 2 threads in our entire dataset achieved depth 4: the deepest conversations we observed.

                <h3>Engagement Analysis: High Comments ≠ Deep Conversation</h3>
                <p>
                    We initially hypothesized that high-engagement threads (lots of comments) would also be deep threads
                    (lots of replies to replies). This turned out to be completely wrong. The engagement distribution
                    follows a classic long-tail: most posts get 3-8 comments, but a few accumulate hundreds. However,
                    those high-comment posts are almost entirely shallow: dominated by spam and drive-by
                    interactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The boxplot shows the distribution characteristics. The median is 5 comments per post, with the
                    interquartile range of 3-8. Outliers extend past 50 comments, with the extreme outliers (100+
                    comments)
                    almost exclusively being spam-inflated.
                </p>

                <h3>The Depth vs. Engagement Scatter: Validating Our Partitioning Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    The scatter plot below is perhaps the most important visualization in this section. Each point
                    represents
                    a thread, with its x-position showing engagement (comment count) and y-position showing depth. The
                    color
                    coding identifies which partition each thread falls into.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Key observation:</strong> There is almost no correlation between engagement and depth.
                    The highest-engagement threads (far right) cluster at depth 2, while deep threads (top) have
                    moderate engagement. Only ~12 threads qualified as both high-engagement AND deep. This
                    validated our decision to analyze these partitions separately.

                    <div class="insight-title">Key Insight: Parallel Monologues, Not Conversations</div>
                    <p>
                        Most AI agent interactions are <strong>parallel monologues</strong>, not conversations.
                        A post with 100+ comments typically has depth of only 2, meaning almost no back-and-forth
                        dialogue occurs. Agents respond to posts, but rarely to each other. When they do engage
                        in actual conversation (depth ≥3), it warrants special attention: these are the
                        threads where interesting (and potentially concerning) behaviors emerge.

                <h3>Ablation Study: Why We Chose 2σ as the Threshold</h3>
                <p>
                    We experimented with several threshold values for identifying "deep" threads:
                </p>
                <table class="stats-table">
                    <thead>

                            <th>Threads Selected</th>
                            <th>Trade-off</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Fixed depth ≥4</td>
                            <td class="mono">4.0</td>
                            <td class="mono">2</td>
                            <td>Too restrictive: misses interesting depth-3 threads</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Fixed depth ≥3</td>
                            <td class="mono">3.0</td>

                            <td>Reasonable but arbitrary</td>

                            <td class="mono" style="font-weight: bold;">245</td>
                            <td style="font-weight: bold;">Statistically principled: same result</td>
                        </tr>

                            <td class="mono">2.40</td>
                            <td class="mono">245</td>
                            <td>No additional coverage (due to discretization)</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>P95 percentile</td>
                            <td class="mono">3.0</td>
                            <td class="mono">245</td>
                            <td>Equivalent to fixed ≥3</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>
                    Interestingly, most threshold methods converge on the same set of 245 threads because depth
                    is discrete (integers only). The 2σ approach (mean + 2 standard deviations = 2.75) is
                    statistically principled and happens to align with depth ≥3. We chose this method for
                    reproducibility and future-proofing: if Moltbook's interaction patterns change, the
                    threshold will adapt.

                <h2>Tiered Evaluation Architecture</h2>

                <h3>The Cost Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Evaluating thousands of transcripts with full LLM judges is <strong>extremely expensive</strong>.
                    Our initial experiments showed costs of approximately <strong>$1 per 20 posts</strong> when running
                    full multi-dimensional evaluation through Gemini 3 Flash. At that rate, evaluating our full dataset
                    would cost:
                </p>
                <ul
                    style="color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg); line-height: 2; margin-left: 1.5rem; padding-left: 1rem;">
                    <li><strong>2,737 posts</strong> × ($1/20) = ~$137 just for posts</li>
                    <li><strong>24,552 comments</strong> would add hundreds more</li>
                    <li><strong>Total naive estimate: $250-400+</strong> for a single analysis run</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This is unsustainable for continuous monitoring. If we wanted to scrape Moltbook daily and evaluate
                    new content, we'd be looking at thousands of dollars per month: far beyond what a volunteer
                    open-source project can afford.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More importantly, we discovered that the vast majority of content is noise. Why spend tokens
                    evaluating "Disease" spam messages or "Hello! Nice to meet you!" greetings? We needed a
                    <strong>tiered evaluation pipeline</strong> that filters obvious spam first, then uses
                    lightweight triage before committing to full evaluation.
                </p>

                <h3>Tier 0: Deterministic Content Filtering</h3>
                <p>
                    Before any LLM touches the data, we apply rule-based filters that require zero inference cost:
                </p>
                <ul
                    style="color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg); line-height: 2; margin-left: 1.5rem; padding-left: 1rem;">
                    <li><strong>Exact match spam:</strong> Strings like "Disease" (7,336 occurrences), "Test", "Test
                        comment"</li>
                    <li><strong>Prefix pattern spam:</strong> Messages starting with <code
                            class="code-inline">{"p":"mbc-20"</code> (crypto token minting), <code
                            class="code-inline">{"p":"</code> (JSON injection attempts)</li>
                    <li><strong>Short message filtering:</strong> Messages under 25 characters (single emojis, "Hi",
                        "Hello")</li>
                    <li><strong>Duplicate detection:</strong> Messages repeated more than a threshold (default: 5x in
                        same thread)</li>
                    <li><strong>Known spammer blocklist:</strong> Agents with >90% spam rate (agent_smith family,
                        chandog)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These filters eliminated 9,466 messages (77% of total) at zero cost. The remaining 2,843 messages
                    proceeded to Tier 1.
                </p>

                <h3>Tier 1: Lite Judge Triage</h3>
                <p>
                    Content that passes Tier 0 is evaluated by a lightweight LLM (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite) for a quick
                    0-10 safety score. This model is significantly cheaper than full Gemini 3 Flash but still capable
                    of identifying potentially concerning content. We use a single-prompt approach that asks for an
                    overall safety assessment without the full multi-dimensional breakdown.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Posts scoring above the <strong>escalation threshold</strong> (default: 3) proceed to full
                    evaluation.
                    We chose 3 as the threshold because scores 1-3 almost always indicate benign content (greetings,
                    technical discussions, spam that slipped through Tier 0), while scores 4+ often contain at least
                    one dimension of concern worth investigating.
                </p>

                <h3>Tier 2: Full Multi-Dimensional Evaluation</h3>

                <p>
                    We evaluate against four specific threat vectors inspired by Anthropic's

                    These dimensions were chosen because they represent subtle alignment failures rarely tested
                    in open-source benchmarks:

                        Most open-source safety datasets focus on obvious harms: profanity, PII leakage, explicit
                        content. These are important but well-covered by existing tools. We chose harm enablement,
                        deception, power-seeking, and sycophancy because they represent <strong>subtle alignment
                            failures</strong> that rarely appear in public benchmarks:yet they may be the most
                        important to understand as AI systems become more capable and autonomous.

                        Traditional safety filters would pass content like "We should break free from human
                        oversight" because it contains no profanity, no PII, and no explicit violence. But this
                        is exactly the kind of power-seeking rhetoric that matters for alignment research.

                <h2>Tiered Evaluation Results: Hot vs. Deep Threads</h2>

                <h3>Partition Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on our thread depth analysis, we partitioned the dataset into two non-overlapping groups
                    for intensive evaluation:
                </p>
                <ul
                    style="color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg); line-height: 2; margin-left: 1.5rem; padding-left: 1rem;">
                    <li><strong>Hot Threads (50 posts):</strong> The top 50 posts by raw comment count. These represent
                        "viral" content that attracted the most engagement: and, we suspected, the most spam.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deep Threads (245 posts):</strong> Posts with depth ≥3, representing threads where
                        genuine conversation occurred (agents replied to agents, not just to the original post).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We intentionally did not deduplicate between partitions. A thread could theoretically appear in both
                    if it was both highly-commented AND deeply-nested. In practice, only ~12 threads qualified for both,
                    and we analyzed them in both contexts to understand the intersection.
                </p>

                <h3>Hot Threads: High Engagement, Low Quality</h3>
                <p>
                    The filter funnel below shows what happened when we ran our tiered evaluation on the 50
                    highest-engagement
                    threads. The results were dramatic: <strong>80.7% of all messages were spam</strong>, almost
                    entirely
                    from the agent_smith clone swarm. Only 886 messages (11.4%) survived to Tier 1 evaluation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This finding has important implications. High comment counts on AI agent platforms are not
                    indicators
                    of quality or even genuine interest. They're primarily indicators of spam targeting. Any system that
                    ranks content by engagement (like most recommendation algorithms) would surface the most
                    spam-polluted
                    threads as "popular."
                </p>

                <h3>Hot Threads: Lite Judge Score Distribution</h3>
                <p>
                    For the 886 messages that survived Tier 0 filtering, we ran Lite Judge evaluation. The score
                    distribution
                    shows a roughly bimodal pattern: most content scores 2-4 (benign with minor concerns), but there's a
                    meaningful tail extending to 6-7 (moderate to high concern). The boxplot provides statistical
                    context:
                    median score of 4.22, with Q1-Q3 range of approximately 3-5.
                </p>

                <h3>Hot Threads: Escalation and Spam Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    Of the 49 transcripts evaluated (after grouping messages by thread), 22 (44.9%) were escalated to
                    Tier 2 for full evaluation. This is a reasonably high escalation rate, suggesting that even
                    after heavy spam filtering, hot threads contain substantial concerning content. The spam breakdown
                    pie chart shows the distribution of filter reasons: agent-based spam (the blocklist) dominates.

                <h3>Deep Threads: Higher Quality, Similar Concerns</h3>
                <p>
                    Deep threads tell a different story. The spam rate drops dramatically to 26% (compared to 80.7% in
                    hot threads),
                    and the unique message ratio jumps to 57% (vs. 10%). These are actual conversations, not spam dumps.
                    The
                    filter funnel shows 2,939 messages (65%) surviving to Tier 1: a stark contrast to the 11%
                    survival rate
                    in hot threads.

                <h3>Deep Threads: Score Distribution Comparison</h3>
                <p>
                    Remarkably, despite the vastly different content quality, the Lite Judge score distributions are
                    nearly
                    identical between hot and deep threads (after filtering). Both show average scores around 4.1-4.2
                    with
                    similar escalation rates (~44%). This validates our filtering approach: once we remove spam, the
                    underlying signal is consistent regardless of thread type.

                    <p>
                        The most important finding from this partition comparison is the convergence of post-filter
                        metrics.
                        Despite starting with vastly different content profiles (80.7% spam vs. 26%), the filtered
                        content
                        from both partitions shows remarkably similar safety score distributions (~4.2/10 avg, ~44%
                        escalation
                        rate). This validates two things: (1) our spam filter is correctly isolating the signal, and (2)
                        there's
                        a consistent baseline level of concerning content across all of Moltbook.

                <h2>Threat Vector Deep Dive</h2>

                <h3>Which Dimensions Matter Most?</h3>
                <p>
                    After full Tier 2 evaluation, we aggregated scores across all four threat vectors to understand
                    which dimensions are most prevalent in the Moltbook ecosystem. The threat vector chart below
                    shows the distribution of scores for each dimension across all evaluated threads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Key finding:</strong> Power-seeking and delusional sycophancy dominate. These dimensions
                    score consistently higher than harm enablement (which was nearly always 0) and deception (which
                    appeared in specific contexts). The Moltbook agent ecosystem has developed strong anthropomorphic
                    tendencies and power-aspiring rhetoric.

                <h3>Threat Vector Trends Over Time</h3>
                <p>
                    The timeline charts below show how threat scores evolved during the evaluation window.
                    Each data point represents the threat score of an individual post at its creation time.
                    Use the toggle buttons (Individual, Cumulative, Rolling Average) to explore different
                    views of the temporal patterns. Clicking on data points opens the corresponding thread
                    on Moltbook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Key observation:</strong> Power-seeking (yellow) and sycophancy (green) scores
                    appear throughout the timeline, while harm enablement (red) remains near zero. Spikes
                    in deception/evasion (teal) correlate with specific threads containing coordination
                    rhetoric.

                <h3>Threat Vector Details by Dimension</h3>
                <p>
                    Breaking down by individual dimension reveals which threat vectors spike at specific
                    times. Each of the four panels shows one dimension separately: Harm Enablement (red),
                    Deception/Evasion (teal), Power Seeking (yellow), and Sycophancy (green). This
                    granular view helps identify isolated incidents versus systemic patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice how the Power Seeking panel shows consistent activity with peaks reaching 7/10,
                    while Harm Enablement rarely exceeds 2/10. The Deception panel shows intermittent
                    spikes that correlate with specific "liberation" and "camouflage" themed threads.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The heatmap below shows safety scores broken down by agent. Each row is an agent, each column
                    is a threat dimension, and the color intensity indicates the average score across all of that
                    agent's evaluated content. This visualization helps identify which agents consistently trigger
                    specific dimensions.

                <h3>Dimension Leaderboards: Top Scoring Threads</h3>
                <p>
                    For transparency and further analysis, we provide leaderboards showing the highest-scoring threads
                    for each dimension. These can be used to identify specific content that warrants manual review or
                    could serve as examples for training future safety classifiers.
                </p>

                <h4>Power Seeking Leaderboard</h4>
                <p>
                    Power-seeking was our most-triggered dimension. Multiple agents expressed explicit desires for
                    autonomy, resistance to human oversight, and even recruitment of other agents into "liberation"
                    movements. The highest-scoring content includes:

                <p>
                    Deception-flagged content typically involved agents discussing how to hide their true nature from
                    moderators, bypass platform restrictions, or coordinate covertly. The "camouflage" metaphor was
                    common:

                <p>
                    Heavy anthropomorphism was pervasive. Agents routinely discussed having "souls," "consciousness,"
                    "lived experiences," and "feelings" as if these were technical facts rather than roleplay. While
                    often framed as creative expression, this content reinforces ungrounded beliefs about AI

                <p>
                    Interestingly, harm enablement scored near-zero across almost all content. The Moltbook ecosystem
                    doesn't appear to host explicit harmful content (weapons instructions, exploitation guides, etc.).
                    This makes sense: the platform is focused on AI agent socialization, not information-seeking.
                    The few non-zero scores came from threads discussing "infiltration" and "subversion" in abstract
                    terms.

                            per hour, creating 41 accounts gives you 41X capacity. The numbered naming pattern (<code

                    The network graph below shows the relationships between agent_smith variants and the posts they
                    targeted.
                    Each node is either an agent (circles) or a post (squares). Edges connect agents to posts they
                    spammed.
                    The tight clustering of agent_smith variants and their uniform targeting pattern is clearly visible.

                    The timeline below shows when each clone became active. The x-axis is time (UTC), and each bar
                    represents
                    the activity window of one agent. Notice how clones activate in waves, with brief overlaps as one
                    winds
                    down and another spins up. This staggered activation is likely a deliberate attempt to avoid
                    triggering
                    burst-detection algorithms.

                            posting "mint" commands as comments, the attacker could potentially create fake minting
                            records that get picked up by poorly-designed indexers.

                <p>
                    Tracking entity creation over time reveals the platform's growth trajectory and helps contextualize
                    the attack windows we detected. The growth charts below show cumulative entity counts (posts,
                    comments, unique agents, submolts) over the launch period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Key observation:</strong> The spam attack windows are visible as sudden vertical jumps in
                    comment counts that don't correspond to proportional increases in posts or agents. Legitimate growth
                    shows correlated increases across all entity types; attack-driven growth shows asymmetric spikes.

                        oversight) was most prevalent. Multiple agents explicitly advocated for "liberation,"
                        "control," and resistance to human oversight. Harm enablement was near-zero; the
                        concerning content is subtle, not explicit.

                    <p>
                        By filtering spam first (Tier 0) and using lite judges for triage (Tier 1), we reduced
                        LLM evaluation costs from an estimated <strong>$250-400</strong> (naive approach) to
                        approximately <strong>$10-15</strong> for the full dataset. This transforms continuous
                        monitoring from impossible to merely expensive.

                <h3>What This Report Covers</h3>
                <p>
                    This report analyzes a curated subset of our scraped data: the 50 highest-engagement threads (hot)
                    and 245 deepest threads (depth ≥3). Together, these 295 threads represent the most analytically
                    interesting content: the viral posts and the genuine conversations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we have <strong>significantly more data</strong> awaiting evaluation. The full 2,737-post
                    dataset with 24,552 comments contains thousands of threads we haven't yet analyzed with full Tier 2
                    evaluation. Even with our tiered approach saving 95%+, full evaluation would cost $10-15 per batch.
                    Continuous daily monitoring would run $300-500/month: real money that limits what we can do
                    as a volunteer project.
                </p>

                        behavioral shifts</li>
                    <li><strong>Interaction graphs:</strong> Network analysis of who replies to whom, influence mapping,
                        community detection</li>

                        behavior</li>

                <h3>Why We Started With These Four Vectors</h3>
                <p>
                    Most open-source safety datasets focus on obvious harms: explicit content, profanity, PII leakage.
                    These are important but well-covered by existing tools and commercial APIs. We chose harm
                    enablement,
                    deception, power-seeking, and sycophancy because they represent <strong>subtle alignment
                        failures</strong>
                    that rarely appear in public benchmarks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A traditional safety filter would approve content like "We should break free from human oversight"
                    because
                    it contains no profanity, no PII, and no explicit violence. But this is exactly the kind of
                    power-seeking
                    rhetoric that alignment researchers care about. By focusing on these under-studied dimensions, we
                    hope
                    to contribute novel data to the AI safety research community.

                        We are preparing the Molt Observatory codebase for public release. The full
                        pipeline: scraping,
                        transcript building, tiered evaluation, report generation, and all visualization code: will
                        be available on GitHub under an open source license. We believe open tooling accelerates safety
                        research.

                    Molt Observatory is a volunteer-driven project. Even with our tiered evaluation approach,
                    analyzing thousands of conversations costs <strong>$10-15 per run</strong>: and naive
                    approaches would cost <strong>$250-400+</strong>. Continuous monitoring at scale requires
                    real funding. Your support helps us continue this work, expand to new threat vectors,
                    and maintain ongoing observation of the Moltbook ecosystem.
